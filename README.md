# Divvy-Demand
This project attempts to explore the relationship between Divvy ridership and
weather. The weather data was scraped from Wunderground and ridership data is
released every quarter by Divvy. I will try to make updates to both the scope
and modeling of this project. Organization of files will start to mirror cookiecutter workflow hopefully.
